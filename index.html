    <div id="description"> These are character biographies for a work-in-progress series I'm working on.</div>
  <div id="grad"><br>
  <br>
  <div id="kat">
    Katrina Stoicheio:<br>
    <br>Katrina is the co.leader of her group. She's a brash, rebellious, and <br>
    confident in her decisions, even if most of them don't work. However,<br>
    she also has a heart of gold deep down, and treats her close friends as if they<br>
    were her family. Some of her interests include tourism, playing electric guitar in a<br>
    small band, and air-gliding.</div>
  <div id="alice">Alice Usagi:<br>
  <br>Alice is the acrobat of the team. She can hastily get from point A to point B with<br>
  little to no trouble, but she isn't exactly the strongest of the team. She's shy and quiet most<br>
  of the time, but can also be brave like her best friend, Katrina, at times. Along with being <br>
  athletic, she's also a rising amatuer EDM artist hoping to make it big like her role models. Her<br>
  interests include playing keyboard, going to dance competitions, making music, etc.</div>
  <div id="cleo">Cleo Patricka:<br>
  <br>The brains of the team, Cleo is one of the more sane, calmer characters of the bunch.<br>
  He's the one who usually comes up with the plans for assigned missions, trying to be organized.<br>
  Despite this, he argues with Katrina time to time due to the differences and whatnot, causing <br>
  him to lose his temper once in a while. His interest include playing piano, drawing, writing, etc.<br></div>
  <div id="waltz">Daniel "Waltz" Tenzon:<br>
  <br>The sane one's best friend, bear.<br></div>
  <div id="enky">Enkidu:<br>
  <br>Shy deer one who joined reluctanly.<br></div>
  <div id="rose">Roselyn Smith:<br>
  <br>Way too optimistic cat who just won't shut up.<br></div>
  </div>
