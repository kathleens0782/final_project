    <div id="description"> Hello there. Since I get asked about my characters a lot, I decided to make a<br>
    page with their small descriptions. For those who haven't heard, this is actually <br>
    for a work-in-progress series I'm currently working on. If you have more <br> questions for 
    these characters, I'll gladly answer them (unless it's spoilers, I can't mention those ;)).</div>
  <div id="grad"><br>
  <br>
  <div id="kat">
    Katrina Stoicheio:<br>
    <br>Katrina is the co.leader of her group. She's a brash, rebellious, and <br>
    confident in her decisions, even if most of them don't work. However,<br>
    she also has a heart of gold deep down, and treats her close friends as if they<br>
    were her family. Some of her interests include tourism, playing electric guitar in a<br>
    small band, and air-gliding.</div>
  <div id="alice">Alice Usagi:<br>
  <br>Alice is the acrobat of the team. She can hastily get from point A to point B with<br>
  little to no trouble, but she isn't exactly the strongest of the team. She's shy and quiet most<br>
  of the time, but can also be brave like her best friend, Katrina, at times. Along with being <br>
  athletic, she's also a rising amatuer EDM artist hoping to make it big like her role models. Her<br>
  interests include playing keyboard, going to dance competitions, making music, etc.</div>
  <div id="cleo">Cleo Patricka:<br>
  <br>The brains of the team, Cleo is one of the more sane, calmer characters of the bunch.<br>
  He's the one who usually comes up with the plans for assigned missions, trying to be organized.<br>
  Despite this, he argues with Katrina time to time due to the differences and whatnot, causing <br>
  him to lose his temper once in a while. His interest include playing piano, drawing, writing, etc.<br></div>
  <div id="waltz">Daniel "Waltz" Tenzon:<br>
  <br>Waltz is the brawns of the team. He's a former wrestler turned bodyguard. Waltz is usually quiet and keeps his thoughts<br>
  to himself most of the time, but he speaks against others when he feels it's necessary. When he isn't busy carrying out <br>
  his side of the missions, he stays with Cleo, his best friend, and helps with his plans. His interest<br>
  include drumming, exercising, etc.</div>
  <div id="enky">Enkidu:<br>
  <br>Enkidu is the archmage of the team, and the medic. He knows all kinds of magic from spritual training. Despite this,<br>
  he's actually the weakest of the team (in terms of strength). Enkidu is shy, and he tries to be careful with everything he does, 
  and really hates short-range combat. He's also technically the oldest person in the team, as well as almost every other person. Enkidu 
  doesn't really have much hobbies, but rather just spends time practicing whatever skills he has.<br>
  </div>
  <div id="rose">Roselyn Smith:<br>
  <br>Roselyn is the team's tank and/or defense. She can create heart-shaped shields to defend herself and her more weaker <br>
  teammates. These shields can also be sharp enough to use as blades. Aside from this, she's almost always very optimistic<br>
  and happy, which usually brightens the mood around her. She's also a very popular pop star, and a secret journalist under<br>
  a male pen-name. Her interest include wakeboarding, reading Marvel comics, playing video games, etc.</div>
